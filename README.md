# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```
In this code the function mystery(a) starts by checking if the array 'a' is equal to the length of 1. This is the base case. If the array length is 1, then the function 
returns the value stored in the array at index 0. The function then delcares a variable called foo. This variable is set equal to mystery(a.slice(1, a.length)). This part of the code uses recursion to iterate through the entire array.  
Once the base case is reached the function will return a value from a[0]. The function then checks if the value stored in foo is greater than the value in the a[0] index of the array. 
If the value for foo is greater than a[0] the function will return foo. Otherwise the function will return the value for a[0]. With that being said this function uses recursion iterate through the 
array and return the varible foo which will be the larget value in the array.
